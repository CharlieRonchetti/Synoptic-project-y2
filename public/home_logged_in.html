                <h3>Our System</h3>
                <p>As a team of five we have come together to create a 
                    prototype system for the people of the Cape York 
                    peninsula of Australia to help with the transport 
                    issues they face over a year and especially through 
                    the monsoon season around the area. Our system is a 
                    route planner which allows the users to input a 
                    starting location and an end location with a route 
                    being displayed on a map, allowing the user to have 
                    reliable and safe directions to their destination. 
                    The system intends to include weather statistics, 
                    which can be viewed specifically for their route, 
                    allowing them to make judgements on their willingness 
                    to travel if the conditions are not satisfactory. 
                    Along with these features, our system intends to 
                    include an emergency SOS button built into it allowing 
                    the users to send their current location to emergency 
                    services should they come into trouble when travelling 
                    around Cape York, as well as a discussion board where 
                    all the users of the system can communicate among each 
                    other on the system to post updates on the 
                    accessibility of different routes as well as request 
                    lifts to and from different destinations. </p>
